# Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms
# Run in O(mlogn) where m is edges and n is vertices
# All greedy algorithms, requiring undirected graph represented as an adjacency list

# Output: Minimum cost tree that spans all vertices and has the following properties:
# 1 - The tree has no cycles
# 2 - The subgraph is connected (contains a path between all pairs of vertices)
# Can check for connectedness using Depth-first Search

# Prim-Jarnik's Algorithm 1957 - Similar to Djikster's algorithm
